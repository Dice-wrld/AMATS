   • Complete audit trail of user activity (AuditLog model)
   • Network-aware auto-update via MAC address detection (NetworkScanner class)

2. SPRINTS IMPLEMENTED (Agile/Scrum-Lite) ✓
   Sprint 1: User authentication module - COMPLETE
   Sprint 2: Asset database creation - COMPLETE
   Sprint 3: Issuance and return workflow - COMPLETE
   Sprint 4: Auto-update network detection - COMPLETE (Python Nmap-style scanner)
   Sprint 5: Reporting and logs - COMPLETE (CSV export + audit logs)
   Sprint 6: UI refinement and testing - COMPLETE (Bootstrap 5 + Unit tests)

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ✓
   • 3-Tier Architecture implemented:
     - Presentation Layer: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
     - Application Layer: Django 4.2 LTS (Python backend)
     - Data Layer: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production ready)

4. SECURITY FEATURES ✓
   • Password hashing with PBKDF2
   • CSRF protection on all forms
   • Session management
   • Role-based access control (permission_required decorators)
   • IP address logging for all transactions
   • Security headers for production (HSTS, XSS protection, etc.)
   • Input validation and sanitization

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS CHECKLIST
-----------------------------------

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS (Met in code):
✓ Workstation for development - Supported
✓ Local server environment - Django dev server included
✓ Network switch/router support - Scanner config for any subnet

✓ MySQL/SQLite - SQLite default, MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible
✓ HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Bootstrap 5 frontend
✓ Localhost server - XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP compatible
✓ Network scanning script - Custom Python implementation
✓ Git/GitHub ready - .gitignore configured

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (All implemented):
✓ Authenticate users with unique credentials
✓ Differentiate user roles (Admin/Technician)
✓ Add, edit, delete asset records
✓ Issue equipment and record returns
✓ Display current asset status
✓ Auto-update device status on network reconnect
✓ Generate overdue alerts
✓ Produce activity logs and reports

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (All addressed):

✓ Scalability: Modular design, additional categories supported
✓ Reliability: Atomic transactions, validation checks
✓ Performance: Optimized queries, pagination
✓ Maintainability: Modular code, comments, documentation
✓ Portability: Runs on Windows (XAMPP) or Linux (LAMP)

KEY FEATURES UNIQUE TO FIELD STUDY
----------------------------------

NETWORK-AWARE ASSET DETECTION:
- Scans network by subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Detects devices by MAC address matching
- Automatically updates "last seen" timestamp
- Flags missing assets that reappear on network
- Triggers alerts when missing devices reconnect

AUDIT TRAIL COMPLIANCE:
- Logs every: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, LOGIN, LOGOUT, ISSUE, RETURN, SCAN
- Captures username, timestamp, IP address, description
- Immutable logs (cannot be edited via admin)
- Filterable by date range, action type, user

BROADCAST INDUSTRY SPECIFIC:
- Categories: Cameras, Servers, Network Equipment, Storage Media
- MAC address tracking for broadcast equipment
- Maintenance scheduling for critical broadcast gear
- Assignment tracking for field equipment

DOCUMENTATION INCLUDED
----------------------
1. README.md - Complete setup and usage guide
2. inline code comments
3. Docstrings for all classes and functions
4. User stories implemented as features
5. Test suite with unit tests
